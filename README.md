Welcome to hiddenidentity.games/blood-on-the-clocktower

This project is built to help facilitate in-person playing of Blood on the Clocktower.

This was built by a couple of nerds who just wanted to help our gaming group get more games in, and have fun doing it.

If you find this useful, please make sure to buy the [official game](https://bloodontheclocktower.com/about-us)
Also, I highly suggest supporting [Blood on the Clocktower](https://www.patreon.com/botconline/posts) on Patreon!

A lot of the leg-work for this was borrowed from [TownSquare](https://github.com/bra1n/townsquare), who generated a lot of content we reused. So a big shoutout to them!

Any feedback is very welcome in github issues!

Any questions contact hiddenidentity.games@gmail.com
